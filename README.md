# Binomial Coefficient Calculator 

This project provides a simple implementation of the **binomial coefficient** calculation in Python based on **Pascal's Rule**.

The binomial coefficient, also known as "n choose r" or nCr, is used in combinatorics to determine the number of ways to choose `r` elements from a set of `n` elements without regard to the order of selection.

## ðŸ§  Formula

This implementation uses the recursive identity from Pascal's Rule:
C(n, r) = C(n-1, r-1) + C(n-1, r)


## ðŸš€ How to Use
### 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ayegwalo/binomial-coefficient.git
